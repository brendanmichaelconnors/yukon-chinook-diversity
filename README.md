Data and code to reproduce analyses in:
> Population diversity in Canadian-origin Chinook salmon: portfolio quantification and implications for conservation, harvest, equity, and resilience. In preparation. Connors B.M., Siegle M.R., Harding J., Rossi S., Staton B., Jones M., Bradford M., Browne R., Bechtol B., Doherty B. and S. Cox.

This project consists of 3 primary components: 
1. a state-space run-reconstruction model fitted to daily estimates of total border passage and population composition to estimate annual population-specific border passage and spawner abundance; 
2. age-structured state-space spawner-recruitment models to characterize diversity in population dynamics; and 
3. various analyses to quantify the consequences of population diversity for portfolio effects and equilibrium trade-offs between harvest and overfishing risk in the system.

Project made possible by grant 1701 from the Arctic-Yukon-Kuskokwim Sustainable Salmon Initiative
