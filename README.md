# yukon-chinook-diversity
Data and code to (1) estimate annual population-specific border passage and abundance via a state-space run-reconstruction model fitted to daily estimates of total border passage and population composition, (2) characterize diversity in population dynamics by fitting age-structured, state-space spawner-recruitment models and (3) quantify the consequences of population diversity for portfolio effects and equilibrium trade-offs between harvest and overfishing risk:

> Population diversity in Canadian-origin Chinook salmon: portfolio quantification and implications for conservation, harvest, equity, and resilience. In preparation. Connors B.M., Siegle M.R., Harding J., Rossi S., Staton B., Jones M., Bradford M., Browne R., Bechtol B., Doherty B. and S. Cox.

Project made possible by grant 1701 from the Arctic-Yukon-Kuskokwim Sustainable Salmon Initiative
